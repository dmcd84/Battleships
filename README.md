# Battleships
Battleships created using python

# Intent
- The intent of this project is to develop an object-orientated game of Battleship.
- The intent is to do this using Test Driven Development.
- It may utilise [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) to facilitate functionality as a game.
- The first iteration of this game will be played on the command line. Then it may well be developed into a full GUI game, even deployed given enough patience.
