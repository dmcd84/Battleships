## Intent
- The intent of this project is to develop an object-orientated game of Battleship.
- The intent is to do this using Test Driven Development.
- The first iteration of this game will be played on the command line. Then it may well be developed into a full GUI game, even deployed given enough patience.
- It may utilise pygame to facilitate functionality as a game.

## Resources
* Battleship wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/news) - a python based library for game development.

### To do
- Script User Stories.
- Create game logic.
- Have a playable game with win and lose states.
- Create a GUI.
- Deploy to Heroku - or other such platform.

## User Stories
```
(EPIC)
As a lover of retro games,
So I can amuse myself and my friends,
I would like to play the game of Battleships.

(User Stories)

As a player,
So I can visualise the game,
I would like to see the board.

As a player,
So I can take a shot,
I need to input my desired co-ordinates.

As a player,
So I know if my shot was a hit against the enemy ships,
I would like to receive confirmation of a hit.

As a player,
So I know if my shot missed the enemy ship,
I would like to receive confirmation of a miss.

As a player,
So I know if I have sunk a ship,
I would like a notification of such event.

As a player,
So I know who won the game,
I would like to know the win state at the end of the game.

As a lonely player,
So the game can be more interactive,
I would like to play against an opponent.
